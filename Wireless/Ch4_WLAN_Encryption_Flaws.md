[WEP](#wep)
# WEP
WEP ()was the original security protocol used to secure wireless networks. 
However, it has since been deprecated due to serious vulnerabilities.

## WEP Vulnerabilities
WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher for encrypting data in transmission. Encryption keys used in WEP
are derived from the WEP key entered into the WAP and the wireless devices. WEP then uses an initialization
vector (IV) to create the keys used for RC4. WEP includes the IV in plaintext, both devices already know the
password so it isn't included. When the other device receives the packet, it combines the IV included in the
packet with the password to decrypt the packet. This combination results in: **IV + Password = Key stream**
The small IV (24 bits) used in WEP resulted in devices reusing the keys. Each packet is encrypted using a unique
key stream. The IV is used to generate the key streams

In IV attacks, the attacker uses packet injection to add additional packets into the data stream. The WAP, responds
with more packets, increasing the probabilty that it will resuse a key. An IV attack using packet injection decreases
the time it takes to crack a WEP key.
