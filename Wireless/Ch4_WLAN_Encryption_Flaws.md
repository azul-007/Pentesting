# WLAN Encryption

# WEP
WEP ()was the original security protocol used to secure wireless networks. 
However, it has since been deprecated due to serious vulnerabilities.

## WEP Vulnerabilities
WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher for encrypting data in transmission. Encryption keys used in WEP
are derived from the WEP key entered into the WAP and the wireless devices. WEP then uses an initialization
vector (IV) to create the keys used for RC4. WEP includes the IV in plaintext, both devices already know the
password so it isn't included. When the other device receives the packet, it combines the IV included in the
packet with the password to decrypt the packet. This combination results in: **IV + Password = Key stream**
The small IV (24 bits) used in WEP resulted in devices reusing the keys. Each packet is encrypted using a unique
key stream. The IV is used to generate the key streams.

In IV attacks, the attacker uses packet injection to add additional packets into the data stream. The WAP, responds
with more packets, increasing the probabilty that it will resuse a key. An IV attack using packet injection decreases
the time it takes to crack a WEP key.

## Cracking WEP
To crack WEP we need to:
1. Capture a large number of packets/IVs using **airodump-ng**
2. Knock off authenticated users using **aireplay-ng**
3. Analyze the captured IVs and crack the keys using **aircrack-ng**

## Fake Authentication
**Description**
The fake authentication attack allows you to perform the two types of WEP authentication (Open System and Shared Key) plus associate with the access point (AP). This is only useful when you need an associated MAC address in various aireplay-ng attacks and there is currently no associated client. It should be noted that the fake authentication attack does NOT generate any ARP packets. Fake authentication cannot be used to authenticate/associate with WPA/WPA2 Access Points.

**Problem**:
* APs only communicate with connected clients.
* We can't communicate with the AP.
* Therefore we can't start the attack.

**Solution:** Associate with the AP before launching the attack using Fake Auathentication

1. Ensure you're wireless adapter is running in promiscous mode
2. Run airodump-ng:
   * **airodump-ng --bssid <target_MAC> --channel <target_channel> -w name_of_file wlan0mon**
   * Take note of the #Data field, you will see it barely increase or not at all. So we need
   to associate with this AP to generate traffic.
3. Use **aireplay-ng** to associate to the network. Your adapters MAC will be the first 12 characters. Replace "-" with ":"
   * **aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <target_MAC> -h <your_MAC> wlan0mon**
   * Look at the airodump terminal, you will see that your device is now associated to the target AP.
