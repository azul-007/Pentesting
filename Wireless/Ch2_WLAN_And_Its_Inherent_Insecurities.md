The Type field has three types of WLAN frames:

## 1. Management Frames
**Management frames ar responsible for maintaining communication between access points and wireless clients.
They can have the following subtypes:**
* Authentication
* Deauthentication
* Association Request
* Association Response
* Reassociation Request
* Reassociation Response
* Disassociation
* Beacon
* Probe Request
* Probe Response

## 2. Control Frames
**Control frames ensure a proper exchange of data between access points and wireless clients. Control frames can
have the following subtypes:**
* Request to Send
* Clear to Send
* Acknowledgement (ACK)

## 3. Data Frames
**Data frames carry the actual data that is sent on the wireless network. They do not have subtypes.**

# Monitor Mode
* iwconfig
* ifconfig wlan0 up

## Put card into monitor mode
* airmon-ng
* airmon-ng start wlan0
* airmon-ng (you should see your new interface, wlan0mon)

## Sniffing Wireless Packets
* View all Management frames type:
   * wlan.fc.type == 0 and click Apply
   
* View Control frames
   * wlan.fc.type == 1
   
* View Data Frames
   * wlan.fc.type == 2
   
* Select sub-types
   * (wlan.fc.type == 0 ) && (wlan.fc.subtype == 8)
   * View all beacon frames within all Management frames
   
 ## Playing With Filters
 ## Sniffing data packets off our network.
 * Find the channel on which your AP is running
   * airodump-ng --bssid <mac> wlan0mon
 
 * Once the channel is found, lock your wireless card to the same channel
   * iwconfig wlan0mon channel #
   * Verify with iwconfig wlan0mon
   * You should see Frequency: 2.46 GHz, corresponding to CH 11
