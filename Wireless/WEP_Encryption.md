## Cracking WEP

**1) List All Available Wireless Interace Cards**

* You can do this with two commands: iwconfig or airmon-ng
* When putting a card into monitor mode, it will automatically check for interfering processes. It can also be done manually by running the following command:
````
airmon-ng check
````

* Kill interferring processes
````
airmon-ng check kill
````

**2) Enable monitor mode on the interace found in step 1**

**3) Identify the channel your WEP network is operating on**

* execute iwconfig or airmon-ng to get your wireless interface
* use either BSSID or ESSID.
* The channel number will be listed under the "CH" column.
