## Cracking WEP

**1) List All Available Wireless Interace Cards**

* When putting a card into monitor mode, it will automatically check for interfering processes. It can also be done manually by running the following command:
````
airmon-ng check
````

* Kill interferring processes
````
airmon-ng check kill
````

* Kill the network manager(s) before putting card into monitor mode
````
airmon-ng check kill PID
````

* If started already...disable Monitor Mode
````
airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
````

* Restart Network Manager(s)
````
service network-manager start
````

* You can do this with two commands: iwconfig or airmon-ng

**2) Enable monitor mode on the interace found in step 1**

**3) Identify the channel your WEP network is operating on**

* execute iwconfig or airmon-ng to get your wireless interface
* use either BSSID or ESSID.
* The channel number will be listed under the "CH" column.
