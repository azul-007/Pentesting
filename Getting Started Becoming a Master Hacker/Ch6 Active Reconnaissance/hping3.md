## Using Hping3 in Default Mode for Port Scanning
* hping3 -S 192.168.1.116 -p 80
  * Take a look at the output, the flags field returns RA. This indicates that the RST and ACK flags are set.
  * This indicates that the port is closed.
  
* hping3 -S 192.168.1.116 -p 445
  * When scanning port 445/SMB it returns a packet with SA flags, SYN and ACK, indicating that the port is open.
  
* hping3 -S 192.168.1.116 -p ++1
  * This will scan all ports incrementally.
  
## Fragmenting Packets
You can sometimes bypass IDSs and firewalls by fragmenting packets with the **-f** switch. Since the packet is broken
into many small fragments of the original packet the IDS or firewall's attack signature won't match these fragmented
packets.

* hping3 -S -f 192.168.1.116 -p 80

## Predicting Sequence Numbers
Sequence numbers are used by TCP/IP to make certain that packets that don't arrive in the proper sequence can be reordered
at the target in the same sequence they were sent. All packets won't take the same path so they may not arrive in the same
order.

A MiTM must set these sequence numbers properly. OS devs do not use sequence numbers serially to protect against these types of attacks. They now use algorithms to generate sequence numbers to make it harder to conduct a MiTM attack. Hping3 enables us to collect the sequence numbers so that we can later predict them for MiTM and other attacks.

Scan a site and collec the sequence numbers with the **-Q** switch
* hping3 -Q -S google.com -p 80

Given enough of sequence numbers, we can determine the algorithm and then predict the sequence numbers for an effective
MiTM attack.

## Using hping3 to get the System Uptime
This means how determining how long it's been since the system has been rebooted and/or patched with security updates.

The TCP protocol has a field named "timestamp" that calculates the seconds since the OS was last booted up. We can retrieve
that value by using the "-tcp-timestamp" switch in hping3. It will go out to the target system and retrieve this field, and then convert it into days, hours, minutes and seconds.
* hping3 --tcp-timestamp -S google.com -p 80

## Website Active Reconnaissance
WhatWeb is a Python script that probes the website for signatures of the server, the CMS and other technologies used to develope the site:
 * CMS
 * Blogging platforms
 * Statistic/Analysus packages
 * Javascript libraries
 * Web Servers and embedded systems
 * Identifies version numbers, email addresses, accounts IDs, web framework modules, SQL errors and more.
