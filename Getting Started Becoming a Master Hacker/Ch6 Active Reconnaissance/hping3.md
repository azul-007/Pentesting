## Using Hping3 in Default Mode for Port Scanning
* hping3 -S 192.168.1.116 -p 80
  * Take a look at the output, the flags field returns RA. This indicates that the RST and ACK flags are set.
  * This indicates that the port is closed.
  
* hping3 -S 192.168.1.116 -p 445
  * When scanning port 445/SMB it returns a packet with SA flags, SYN and ACK, indicating that the port is open.
  
* hping3 -S 192.168.1.116 -p ++1
  * This will scan all ports incrementally.
  
## Fragmenting Packets
You can sometimes bypass IDSs and firewalls by fragmenting packets with the **-f** switch. Since the packet is broken
into many small fragments of the original packet the IDS or firewall's attack signature won't match these fragmented
packets.

* hping3 -S -f 192.168.1.116 -p 80

## Predicting Sequence Numbers
Sequence numbers are used by TCP/IP to make certain that packets that don't arrive in the proper sequence can be reordered
at the target in the same sequence they were sent. All packets won't take the same path so they may not arrive in the same
order.

A MiTM must set these sequence numbers properly. OS devs do not use sequence numbers serially to protect against these types of attacks. They now use algorithms to generate sequence numbers to make it harder to conduct a MiTM attack. Hping3 enables us to collect the sequence numbers so that we can later predict them for MiTM and other attacks.
