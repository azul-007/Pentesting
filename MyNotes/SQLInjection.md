## SQL Injection
In A SQL Injection attack, the attacker enters additional data into the web page form to query the SQL database.

## Common SQL Injection Statements
Select * FROM accounts WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = 'aaa' OR 1=1 #'

* Login Bypass:
* admin#
* aa' or 1=1#

There are two ways that these statements are detected; through the client side or the server side. If it's happening on the client side, the characters are being filtered before it gets sent to the server. This makes it easier to intercept using Burp Proxy.
